[Application of a data-driven approach for maximum fatigue damage prediction of an unbonded flexible riser](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=ELLYAXQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=ELLYAXQAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC)

**Tianjiao Dai**, Jiaxuan Zhang, Chao Ren*, Yihan Xing, Svein S√¶vik, Naiquan Ye, Xing Jin, Jun Wu

**Ocean Engineering, 2024**

- The AK-MDAmax approach efficiently predicts long-term fatigue damage of unbonded flexible risers with sufficient accuracy while accounting for all 400 sea states.

- The approach accurately identifies the maximum fatigue damage location across different assessment scales, with errors in long-term fatigue damage predictions ranging from 0.35% to 0.89%.

- Compared to traditional numerical analysis, the AK-MDAmax approach significantly improves computational efficiency by reducing the required sea states from 400 to 15, achieving a 27-fold enhancement in fatigue assessment efficiency.
